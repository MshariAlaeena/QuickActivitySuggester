# Activity Suggestion Express App

This simple project is an Express.js web application that interfaces with the Bored API to provide users with random activity suggestions. It's designed to demonstrate the use of Express for server-side logic, Axios for making HTTP requests, and EJS for rendering dynamic content based on user input. This project is ideal for those looking to understand the basics of building web applications with Express.js.
